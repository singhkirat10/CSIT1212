    <h1>XML</h1>
    <h3>What is XML?</h3>
    <p>XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. It is a markup language and a file-format that is designed for storing and transmitting data. There are no predefined tags to use, instead this tool allows one to define their own tags based on the needs. Since, the format of XML is standardized, it helps transmit XML across systems, platforms, locally or over the internet, and the recipient can parse data due to standardized rules/syntax</p>
    <h3>How is XML used?</h3>
    <p>XML is used for many aspects of web-development, including storing and transferring data across systems and applications. XML is only data, it does not have any information about how to display that data. Because of the standard format of XML, it can be parsed and interpreted by all types of programming languages and applications.<br>Some of the uses of XML are:
    <ul>
      <li>Data Transfer</li>
      <li>Formatting documents</li>
      <li>Web Applications</li>
      <li>Data type to support programming language</li>
    </ul> 
    <h3>What does XML look like?</h3>
    <p>Sample XML code snippet:</p>
    <textarea rows="12" cols="80">
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
        <catalog>
          <book>
            <title>Web Development & Design Foundations with HTML5</title>
            <author>Terry Felke-Morris</author>
            <year>2022</year>
            <price>$125</price>
          </book>
        </catalog>
    </textarea>
    <p>The root element in the example is &lt;catalog&gt;. All elements in the document are contained within &lt;catalog&gt;.</p>
    <p>The &lt;book&gt; element has 4 children: &lt;title&gt;, &lt;author&gt;, &lt;year&gt; and &lt;price&gt;.</p>

    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>JavaScript is a programming or scripting language for the webpages. JavaScript can dynamically update content, control multimedia, animate images, and provide interoperability across different browsers and devices.</p>
    <h3>How is JavaScript related to HTML and CSS?</h3>
    <p>JavaScript is either embedded directly into a webpage or reference from via a separate .js file. The browser runs this script along side HTML and CSS code, that the user is trying to open in browser; thus creating a functional, dynamic page. </p>
    <p>We use HTML to give structure and purpose to our content. CSS adds style rules to the content for display, for example background colors, fonts, layouts. And JavaScript add functionality and dynamic behavior that can respond to user interactions on a webpage</p>

    <h3>Common JavaScript elements</h3>
    <p>Some common elements you will come across in JavaScript are: Variables (var), Objects, functions, events. 
       <textarea rows="15" cols="80">
          
          Examples of different types of variables:
     
          var x = 5;
          var carName = "Volvo";

          Example of objects:
          const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

          Example of functions:
          // Function to compute the product of p1 and p2
          function myFunction(p1, p2) {
                return p1 * p2;
          }
      </textarea>
    </p>
